# Library
This is a library I built with Bootstrap and SCSS (Sass) to fiddle with object constructors. 
The library adds books of your choosing and lets you know of each book's reading status. Here's how it works:

# How to Use
First, click on the 'NEW BOOK' button:

It shall give you a small form requiring the book's details: author, title, pages, and your reading status (true or false).

Then, click the 'Add' button to add the book to the library, or the 'Reset' button if you change your mind and want to add other details.

Once you click 'Add', your book is added to the library.

_"Whoops, I've accidentally added a book that I read as unread!"_

If you assign your reading status incorrectly, don't worry, you can always change the status within the library itself on the 'Change read status option' inside the added book.

Finally, if you wish to remove a book from your library, you may do so by clicking the 'Delete Book' button inside the book:

Bam, your book has been deleted.

Feel free to add as many book as you like!

Enjoy your library. :)

UPDATE:
19/12/2023 - Implemented Class after learning about the feature (despite them being syntactic sugar, in my opinion).
